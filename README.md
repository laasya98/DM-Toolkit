Welcome to the DM Toolkit.

This DM assistant comes preloaded with a generated adventure
set-up and the ability to generate your own.

In order to run the DM Tookit, you must install a csv library in the toplevel. Enter "opam install csv" to install it.

From there, simply "make play" should bring up the interface.

Enter the name of the game file you'd like to load.

One basic command is "help", which brings up the entire helpfile for the toolkit. You can add arguments for particular commands to get just that help file. "help commands" brings up a list of commands.
